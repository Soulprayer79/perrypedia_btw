# perrypedia_btw

This is just a small program to simplifiy the generation of BTW on https://www.perrypedia.de/wiki/Hauptseite
Just put it in an online python interpreter like https://www.online-python.com/ and enter the year to generate and copy and paste the result into the mediawiki.
Just as simple as that!
